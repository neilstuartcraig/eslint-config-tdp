# eslint-config-tdp

This is my [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) [shareable config file](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs). You're very welcome to use this and to contribute to it but I'm going to be pretty selfish with any changes/updates as config is a personal thing and I have a slightly odd programming style so what works for me probably isn't great for many/most others - or maybe it is, let me know!

## Using eslint-config-tdp
See '[using a shareable config](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs#using-a-shareable-config)' on eslint.org. tl;dr: it's essentially adding this package as a dependency to your NPM package and using the eslint [extends](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#extending-configuration-files) syntax.

## Contributing
With the above caveat, contributions are very welcome for fixes, improvements, new features, documentation, bug reports and/or ideas. Please create a Github issue initially so we can discuss and agree actions/approach and whether it's a good fit - that should save time all-round.

The ideal way to receive contributions is via a [Github Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from/to the master branch.
